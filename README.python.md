# Iroh Python

This is the [Iroh](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh) Python API!

The API was generated using [uniffi-rs](https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs).

All iroh classes, methods, functions, and enums contain docstrings.

The current best way to understand how the iroh python API can be used is to check out our 
[example](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh-ffi/blob/main/python/main.py) or [tests](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh-ffi/tree/main/python).

We currently ship binary wheels on pypi for:
- amd64 win
- x86_64 manylinux2014
- aarch64 manylinux2014
- arm64 macosx
- x86_64 macosx

Notes on how the wheels are built and tested are in our [FFI development docs](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh-ffi/blob/main/DEVELOPERS.md#python).
