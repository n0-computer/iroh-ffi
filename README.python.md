# Iroh Python

This is the [Iroh](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh) python api!

The api was generated using [uniffi-rs](https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs).

All iroh classes, methods, functions, and enums contain docstrings.

The current best way to understand how the iroh python api can be used is to check out our [tests](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh-ffi/tree/main/python).

We currently ship binary wheels on pypi for:
- amd64 win
- x86_64 manylinux2014
- aarch64 manylinux2014
- arm64 macosx
- x86_64 macosx
