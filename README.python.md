# Iroh Python

This is the [Iroh](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh) python api!

The api was generated using [uniffi-rs](https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs).

ðŸš§ please excuse us as we get our docs up and running ðŸš§

The current best way to understand how the iroh python api can be used is to check out our [tests](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh-ffi/tree/main/python).

We currently ship binary wheels on pypi for:
- amd64 win
- x86_64 manylinux2014
- aarch64 manylinux2014
- arm64 maxosx
- x86_64 maxosx

If you need another platform you will have to build from source using the repository at https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh-ffi/
