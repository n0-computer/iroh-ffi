# Iroh Python

This is the [Iroh](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh) python api!

The api was generated using [uniffi-rs](https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs).

ðŸš§ please excuse us as we get our docs up and running ðŸš§

The current best way to understand how the iroh python api can be used is to check out our [tests](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh-ffi/tree/main/python).
