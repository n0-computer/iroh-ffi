# Iroh Node.js

This is the [Iroh](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh) node.js api!

The api was generated using [napi-rs](https://github.com/napi-rs/napi-rs).

All iroh classes, methods, functions, and enums contain docstrings.

The current best way to understand how the iroh node.js api can be used is to check out our [tests](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh-ffi/tree/main/js).

## testing
Run tests using jest:

`npm test`
