# Iroh Expo Module

An iroh expo / react native [module](https://docs.expo.dev/modules/overview/). Highly experimental work-in-progress that currently only supports a small set of the iroh API, and only on iOS.

In theory we should be able to publish this as an npm package & add it to an expo app via an `npm install`
